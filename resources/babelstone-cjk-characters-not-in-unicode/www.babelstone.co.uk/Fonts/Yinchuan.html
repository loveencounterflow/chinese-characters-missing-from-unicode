<h3>Description</h3>
<p><b>Tangut Yinchuan</b> v. 11.001 is a font for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangut_script" title="Wikipedia : Tangut script">Tangut script</a> that supports the full set of Tangut characters defined in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode11.0.0/">Unicode version 11.0</a> (<a href="http://www.unicode.org/Public/11.0.0/charts/blocks/U17000.pdf">Tangut code chart</a>). It is based on a font named XXZT (西夏字体 in Chinese) that was designed by Prof. Jing Yongshi 景永时 of the Beifang Ethnic University (北方民族大学) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinchuan" title="Wikipedia : Yinchuan">Yinchuan</a>. The original font was used for typesetting the revised 2nd edition of the Tangut-Chinese dictionary <i>Xià-Hàn Zìdiǎn</i> 夏漢字典 (Beijing, 2008) by Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Fanwen" title="Wikipedia : Li Fanwen">Li Fanwen</a> 李范文.</p>

<p>The original font (XXZT) was remapped to Unicode code points and extended to cover all Unicode Tangut ideographs and components by Andrew West and <a href="http://www.evertype.com/" title="Evertype">Michael Everson</a>. We have also made numerous glyph changes, most of which are documented in <a href="http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n4588.pdf" title="SC2/WG2 N4588">WG2 N4588</a> (<i>Tangut glyph corrections</i> by Andrew West, Viacheslav Zaytsev, Sun Bojun, Michael Everson). This modified font is used for Tangut ideographs and Tangut components in the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 code charts. Tangut Yinchuan is a fork of the code chart font.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>This font is based on the font used for Tangut ideographs and Tangut components in the Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 code charts. However, glyph corrections have been made to 34 Tangut ideographs and one Tangut component, as documented in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4723-glyphCorrectionFor 3Tangut.pdf" title="Unicode Technical Note #42 : Tangut Character Additions and Glyph Corrections">Unicode Technical Note #42</a> (<i>Tangut Character Additions and Glyph Corrections</i> by Andrew West and Viacheslav Zaytsev). Some of these glyph corrections have already been applied to the Unicode 10.0 code charts, and the rest should be applied in Unicode 11.0 and 12.0, but they have all already been applied in this version of the Tangut Yinchuan font. A number of other as yet undocumented glyph changes have also been made (affected characters are listed under Version History for versions 10.000 and 11.000).</li>
<li>11 Tangut characters that have been accepted for encoding in a future version of the Unicode Standard are included in the Private Use Area at U+F000 through U+F00A. The 5 characters at U+F000 through U+F004 are scheduled for inclusion in Unicode version 11.0 at U+187ED through U+187F1 (see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4923-5theditionDAM1chart.pdf" title="Additional repertoire for ISO/IEC 10646:2017 (5th ed.) Amendment 1 (DAM1)">WG2 N4922</a> p. 104), and the 6 characters at U+F005 through U+F00A are provisionally scheduled for inclusion in Unicode version 12.0 at U+187F2 through U+187F7 (see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4922-5theditionPdam2-2-charts.pdf" title="Additional repertoire for ISO/IEC 10646:2017 (5th ed.) Amendment 2.2">WG2 N4922</a> p. 66). Infomation about these additional Tangut characters is provided in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/wg2/docs/n4723-glyphCorrectionFor 3Tangut.pdf" title="Unicode Technical Note #42 : Tangut Character Additions and Glyph Corrections">Unicode Technical Note #42</a> Three additional candidates for encoding are included at U+F00B through U+F00D.</li>
<li>93 unencoded Tangut components are included in the Private Use Area at U+E000 through U+E216. Of these, the four components at U+E002 through U+E005 are candidates for encoding in the future.</li>
<li>349 variant glyphs for Tangut ideographs are included in the Supplementary Private Use Area at U+F0000 through U+F0160. However, it is anticipated that most of these will be replaced by <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr37/tr37-9.html" title="UTS #37: Unicode Ideographic Variation Database">Ideographic Variation Sequences</a> in a future version of this font. Please note that characters in the Private Use Areas are not stable, and may be moved or removed in future versions of the font.</li>
